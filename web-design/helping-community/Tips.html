    <h2 class="beans">Tip #5: Keep your Room Cool</h2>
    <img src="images/keep-your-room-cool.jpg" alt="Woman reading a book in Bed" style="width: 30%;" class="center">
    <p class="potato">An excellent hack to fall asleep faster is to keep your bedroom at a cool temperature — but not too cold. Body temperature naturally drops when you begin to fall asleep. By maintaining this cooler temperature in the environment, you will increase your chance of a good night’s sleep.</p>
